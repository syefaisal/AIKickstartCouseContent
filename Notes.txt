Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a data analysis approach focused on summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset, often using statistical graphics and visualizations. It helps in understanding the data, identifying patterns, spotting anomalies, and formulating hypotheses before diving into more formal modeling or statistical testing. [1, 2]  
Key aspects of EDA: 

• Summarizing Data: EDA aims to condense the data into understandable summaries, both numerical and visual, to grasp the overall structure and distribution. [3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  
• Identifying Patterns and Anomalies: By visualizing data and calculating summary statistics, EDA helps reveal trends, relationships, and unusual observations (outliers). [1, 1, 2, 5, 8, 8]  
• Formulating Hypotheses: EDA provides a foundation for developing testable hypotheses and guiding further analysis. [1, 1, 9, 9]  
• Data Preparation: EDA can reveal data quality issues, such as missing values or inconsistencies, which need to be addressed before more advanced analysis. [2, 7, 7, 9, 10, 11]  
• Iterative Process: EDA is not a linear process, but rather an iterative cycle of exploration, visualization, and refinement of questions. [12, 12]  

Why is EDA important? 

• Better Understanding of Data: EDA provides a deep understanding of the data's characteristics and potential insights. [1, 7]  
• Informed Decision-Making: The insights gained from EDA inform the selection of appropriate statistical techniques and modeling approaches. [2]  
• Effective Model Building: EDA helps in identifying relevant variables, detecting outliers, and addressing data quality issues, leading to more robust and accurate models. [4, 7]  

Common EDA techniques include: 

• Univariate Analysis: Examining individual variables using histograms, box plots, and descriptive statistics. [3, 3, 13, 13, 14, 15, 16]  
• Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis: Exploring relationships between variables using scatter plots, correlation matrices, and other visualization techniques. [3, 3, 13, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20]  
• Data Cleaning and Transformation: Addressing missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues. [7, 7, 17, 21, 21, 22, 23]  
• Hypothesis Generation: Using EDA to formulate testable hypotheses about the data. [1, 1, 9, 9]
